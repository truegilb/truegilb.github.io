I want to check out machine learning materials and ipython is a popular tool to navigate the notes and code. So I post myself a challenge to set it up on the ATOM based Windows 10 machine 

`choco install python3-x86_32` (requires PowerShell in Admin mode. Pro tip: Win+X to run cmd in Admin mode then type in `powershell`)
  
There are 2 factors in what I choose on the chocolatey pacakges:

* stick with 32 bit libraries since the Win10 tablet is ATOM-based (I know)
* the reason i need python3 is that ipython depends on version 3+

After contemplateing whether I need to compile pip / easy_install by source I am very pleased to learn that pip is in the package which is very very handy! 
 
Then I did `pip install ipython notebook` to acquire ipython and its dependency notebook going.

Then invoking `iphtyhon notebook` launches the book! (soon to be `jupyter notebook` though). Admin mode is not required in this case.

Finally (GRE style):

`pip : python :: gem : ruby`

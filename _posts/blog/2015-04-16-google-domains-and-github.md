You may have noticed that this blog is actually hosted on Github, which has a great feature that hosts blog called [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com). By default all blogs contain the URL xxx.github.io.

If you own a domain like me, you can configure an alias so that your reader can always associate the blog with your domain rather than github's. There are multiple pages to explain how and why this is done, and I want to show you how easy it is on Google Domain console:

<figure>
	<img src="/images/google-domains-CNAME.png"/>
</figure>

After that, just create a one-line text file called CNAME containing exactly truegilb.github.io and we are all set.

Starting to use more and more vi especially on cygwin. I used to like emacs but am now a vi fan. For whole GUI I'd probably go for VS Code now, especially it's cross-platform.

`j` moves the cursor to left while `shift-j` joins two lines (specifically removing the newline character of the current line).

Good stuff.

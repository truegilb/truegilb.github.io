Black spot is a dark, gripping TV series that one can watch on-demand via Amazon Prime (as of Feb 2018). Lots of bad stuff happen in this little French town that is upheld by the fortune of the mayor, who has an interwined past with our heroine, Major Weiss.

Murder, kidnap, mystery, teens, dark forest in a rainy setting. 

Each episode is a self-contained unit that goes through its own story, while revealing more about each character and the town, and evey the overall mystery. Very intriguing.

The District Attroney, who is new to town looks like monk. And even acts like a thinner version of him - not sure if that is a tribute to the great American series.

Highly recommended show.
